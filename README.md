# Joint-distributions-visualisation

Once run, a local web-page is created showing a default version of 3D joint distributions visualisations. 
The aim of this work is to provide intuition behind joint distribution formulas that are taught in undergraduate courses on Statistics.
You can choose two of the distributions from Normal, Exponential, t-distribution and Gamma, as well as set their parameters. 
The resulting 3D visualisation adjusts automatically based on user input. 


This work is one example from the Visualisation of Mathematical Concepts series, that has been adjusted for an ease of use. 
Other examples from the series include visualisations of 3D Markov Chains, more enhanced version of joint distributions that include correlation parameter, and other concepts in optimisation and statistics.
